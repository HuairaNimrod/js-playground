    <!-- Find Odds Coding Challenge -->

    <!-- Welcome! The main instructions for this challenge are in this
		file, with some additional comments in the associate JavaScript and
		CSS files. If you're not sure what to do next, consult this file.
		-->

    <!-- (1) in this HTML file:
			- include an external stylesheet 
			- include an external javascript
			- put your name in a title element
			- and include any other markup that you would normally include or consider. -->
			<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles.css">
			<script src="src/index.js"></script>
			<title>Nim Huaira</title>

    <!-- (2) In the JavaScript file:
			Complete the findOdds Javascript function. Make it take an array as a
			parameter and return the count of items in the array that are odds. Keep this function stand-alone. I.e. it should not know ANYTING about
			DOM. -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- (3) In this file, create a document that when loaded in the browser
			provides
				- an input,
				- a button, and 
				- an element that displays "The odd numbers are blah." -->
	<p>Enter a list of numbers separated by space</p>
	<div>
		<input type="text" id="numbersArray"><br>
		<button onclick="handleClick()">Get Odd Numbers</button>
	</div>
	<p>The Odd numbers are: <span id="result">blah</span></p>


    <!-- (4) In the CSS file:
			Style "blah" (and ONLY "blah") bold and red. -->

    <!-- (5) Add handleClick to the button. Make it create an array of numbers
			using the text in the input. Pass the array of numbers to FindOdd. 
			Replace "blah" with the result, Keep the "glue code" separate from the 
			function you created. That is, keep your function stand-alone, as before. -->
